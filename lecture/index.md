# 10 Minutes to Stage

**Zero Slides. Zero Panic.**

Siyuan He

---

## T-minus 10 Minutes

You're about to present in front of 50 people.

Your topic is clear in your head.

But you have **no slides**.

What do you do?

---

## Option A: PowerPoint

Open PowerPoint. Pick a template.

Drag. Resize. Align. Repeat.

> After 8 minutes: you have **2 slides** and a headache.
> The problem isn't the tool. It's the **workflow**.

---

## Option B: Ask ChatGPT

"Make me a PPT about today's Marp lecture."

You get... a wall of text, weird formatting, no design, not editable.

> AI can write. But it can't **design slides** well yet.

---

## The Real Problem

Traditional slide tools require you to:

- **Manually layout** every element
- **Design** color schemes and fonts
- **Repeat** the same formatting for every slide

> This is a **design task**, not a content task.

---

## What If...

What if you could just **write**, and it automatically becomes slides?

No dragging. No resizing. No design decisions.

Just **text → slides**.

<!-- _class: lead -->

# Enter Marp

![vscode-extension-cover](../assets/image/vscode-extension-cover.png)

---

## Marp in One Line

```markdown
---
marp: true
---

# My Talk

Speaker Name

---

## A Simple Point

> **Markdown + `---` = Presentation**

```

That's it. Every `---` creates a new slide.

---

## Why This Changes Everything

- **Write** in plain text — no GUI needed
- **One file** = entire presentation
- **Git-friendly** — track changes like code
- **Export** to PDF, PPTX, HTML, PNG
- **AI can generate it** — it's just text!

---

## Let's Get Hands-On

Open VSCode now. Follow along.

> We'll go from zero to slides in 5 minutes.

---

## Step 1: Install Marp Extension

1. Open VSCode
2. Go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`)
3. Search **"Marp for VS Code"**
4. Click **Install** (Author: Marp Team)

> That's it. No config needed.

---

## Step 2: Create Your First File

Create a new file called `demo.md` and type:

```markdown
---
marp: true
---

# Hello Marp

Your Name

---

## My First Slide

- Point one
- Point two
- Point three
```

---

## Step 3: Preview

Press `Ctrl+Shift+V` (Windows) / `Cmd+Shift+V` (Mac)

> You should now see a fully rendered slide.

Yes, it's that simple.

---

## Step 4: Export

<div class="columns">
<div class="column">

![vscode-marp-export](../assets/image/vscode-marp-export.png)

</div>
<div class="column">

1. Click the Marp icon in the top right of the markdown workspace
2. Select "Export slide deck..."
3. Choose format:
   **PDF / PPTX / HTML / PNG**

> **Plain text -> Presentation** in 3 steps.

</div>
</div>

---

## Does It Look Good?

Marp has 3 built-in themes:

- **default** — clean white
- **gaia** — modern flat
- **uncover** — minimal

And you can use **custom CSS** for anything.

> Like this slide deck — it's all custom CSS.

---

## Images & Layouts

```markdown
## Key Insight

![bg right:40%](chart.png)

- Marp converts Markdown to slides
- AI generates the content
- Skills ensure consistent quality
```

Left: text. Right: image. One line of code.

---

## So Now We Have Marp

We can write slides in plain text.

But... we still need to **write the content**.

> Who's going to type 30 slides in 8 minutes?

---

<!-- _class: lead -->

# Enter AI

---

## AI + Markdown = Natural Fit

AI is **great at generating text**.

Markdown is **just text**.

So AI can generate an entire slide deck?

> Let's try it.

---

## The AI Output Problem

"Hey Claude, make me 30 slides about this Marp lecture."

Result:

- Inconsistent formatting
- Random heading sizes
- Some slides have 2 bullets, some have 15
- No visual coherence
- Different "style" every time

> It works. But it's **unpredictable**.

---

## What's Going Wrong?

The AI has no idea about:

- How many bullets per slide
- What theme to use
- What CSS looks like
- What "good" slides look like

It's like hiring someone without a **style guide**.

---

<!-- _class: lead -->

# What Shall We Do?

---

## What If AI Had a "Job Manual"?

Imagine giving the AI:

- **Templates** — predefined structures
- **Rules** — "3-5 bullets per slide"
- **Theme files** — CSS it can reference
- **Quality checks** — standards to meet

> This is what **Skills** are.

---

## What Are Skills?

Skills are a mechanism (pioneered by Anthropic) to:

- **Constrain** AI output to specific formats
- **Provide** reference docs and templates
- **Ensure** consistent, reproducible results

> Think of it as a **style guide for AI**
> or "**pre-made** prompts"

---

## How Skills Work

```text
You specify the Skill & describe what you want
            ↓
AI loads templates + rules according to the Skill
            ↓
AI generates within constraints
            ↓
Structured, consistent output
```

**Less randomness & Less negative surprises.**

---

## The `marp-slide` Skill

In this project's `.claude/skills/marp-slide/`:

- **7 theme CSS files** — ready to use
- **Syntax references** — complete Marp docs
- **Best practices** — quality guidelines
- **Image patterns** — common layouts

> Everything the AI needs to make good slides.

---

## How to Use It? Specific Steps?

1. Let AI read the `SKILL.md` file
2. Ask it to make a slide deck on any topic
3. Direct it to use a specific theme and follow the rules
4. The agent will output a `.md` file ready to preview and export

> Generally, let AI read the Skill, pick a theme, follow the rules, and output a `.md` file.

---

## Claude Code Instructions

![bg right:50%](../assets/image/marp-slide-skill-use-cc.png)

1. Open the `Marp` folder as your vscode workspace / `cd` into it in your terminal
2. Open Claude Code sidebar /
   in your terminal
3. Type `/marp-slide`

---

## GitHub Copilot

![bg right:50%](../assets/image/marp-slide-use-copilot.png)

1. Open the Copilot Chat panel, if not opened, click the icon in the top right of VSCode
2. Drag and drop the `SKILL.md` file from the `marp-slide` folder to the chat input

---

## The Prompt

![bg right:50%](../assets/image/marp-slide-skill-prompt.png)

Describe your content (we've prepared a prompt for you):

```text
/marp-slide
Make a 15-slide presentation about
"How to use Marp + AI to make slides"
using the tech theme.
```

---

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

AI will:

1. Load the tech theme CSS via `@import`
2. Structure content with proper headings
3. Keep proper number of bullets per slide
4. Gradually generate a complete `.md` file

---

## The `@import` Trick

Instead of embedding 200 lines of CSS in every file:

```markdown
<style>
@import '.claude/skills/marp-slide/assets/theme-tech.css';
</style>
```

Clean & Reusable.

> That's exactly how this slide deck does.

# The Real Lesson

## It's Not About "Using AI"

**Most people:**

> "AI, make me a PPT" → bad result → "AI doesn't work"

**The problem** isn't the AI.
The problem is **how people use it**.

---

## The Key Insight

> ~~Make AI smarter~~ **Give AI clearer boundaries**

- A good Skill = a good **job manual**
- Constrain the **freedom**, increase the **consistency**
- Same input → Similar quality, every time

---

## Practical Tips

- **Specify the theme** — "use tech theme"
- **Give a page count** — "around 15 slides"
- **Provide an outline** — list the key points
- **Demand consistency** — "3-5 bullets per slide"
- **Iterate** — generate first, then refine

---

## Beyond Marp

The Skill mindset works everywhere:

- Writing docs → create a doc template Skill
- Writing code → create a code style Skill
- Writing reports → create a report format Skill

> Core idea: **trade freedom for reliability**.

## Publish Your Slides to the Web

Now let's put your slides online — so anyone can view them.

---

## Step 5: Export as HTML

1. `Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P` → Command Palette
2. Type `Marp: Export slide deck`
3. Choose **HTML**

> This creates a self-contained `.html` file with everything embedded.

![bg right:40%](../assets/image/export-html.png)

---

## Step 6: Create a Git Repository

In VSCode:

1. Open the folder containing your slides
2. `Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P` → `Git: Initialize Repository`
3. Your project is now a Git repo

![bg right:40%](../assets/image/git-init.png)

---

## Step 7: Commit Everything

1. Go to Source Control (`Ctrl+Shift+G` / `Cmd+Shift+G`)
2. Stage all files (click `+` next to each file)
3. Type a commit message: `"Initial commit"`
4. Click **Commit**

![bg right:40%](../assets/image/git-commit.png)

---

## Step 8: Publish to GitHub

1. Click **Publish to GitHub** in Source Control
2. Choose **Public** repository
3. Confirm — VSCode pushes everything automatically

> Your slides are now on GitHub!

![bg right:40%](../assets/image/github-publish.png)

---

## Now: View Your Slides Online

Your slides are at:

```text
https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/<html-file>.html
```

But remembering that URL is annoying...

> What if we had a launcher page?

---

## The Launcher Page

We'll create an `index.html` that:

1. Asks for your **GitHub username**
2. Asks for your **repository name**
3. Asks for your **HTML filename**
4. Opens your slides in a new browser tab

> A simple HTML page — no server needed.

---

## Create `index.html`

Put this file in your repository root:

```html
<!-- placeholder: full code shown on next slide -->
```

Commit and push it to GitHub.

![bg right:40%](../assets/image/launcher-page.png)

---

## How It Works

```text
User enters:
  → GitHub username: "siyuan-he"
  → Repo name: "my-slides"
  → HTML file: "Slides.html"

Page opens:
  → https://siyuan-he.github.io/my-slides/Slides.html
```

> One page to rule all your Marp presentations.

![bg right:40%](../assets/image/launcher-flow.png)

---

## Try It Out

1. Open your `index.html` on GitHub Pages
2. Enter your details
3. Click **Open**
4. Your slides open in a new tab

> Congratulations — your Marp slides are live on the internet.
